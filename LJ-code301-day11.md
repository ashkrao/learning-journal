## Functional programming was a challenging assignment. It took me a while to get used to the syntax. Although the idea behind using functional programming is to make the code concise, I feel it's better to avoid using functional programming when its not absolutely necessary.

## The chaining of .map(), .filter() & .reduce was too much for me to take in :)
