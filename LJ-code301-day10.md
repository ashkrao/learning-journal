## It was fun working with Roscoe on the SQl assignment for class 9. We made sure to pull-up the tables and check the entries before each TODO which was really helpful. We could not get all the TODOs right because we were both not familiar with the syntax and it took us a while to figure out what each query was doing.

## We learned that INNER JOIN and JOIN are the same and can be used to perform the same operation. INNER JOIN can be used to be more descriptive if the query has other JOINs.
