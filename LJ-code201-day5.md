## I feel so much better after week 2. I love small group code review and I reviewed Sugey and Elaine's code this time. I now have a fair Idea about where I stand. I saw that most of them have hardcoded the 'hours' in the cookie stand project but I managed to have a for loop to generate the hours for each location.     

## The chocolate pizza comp was fun and I enjoyed working with Quinn. I realized the importance of planning before we get to work. I did not get a perfect score on the Choclate pizza comp but we got pretty close to replicating the page.

## I love the way Code fellows values our feedback. I was surprised to see that they actually take our suggestions seriously and work on improving things.
