## It was fun pair programming with Tyler and John. It helps to have an extra person while pair programming. We learned to apply the removeClass method to prevent the class from loading each time the clone method was called.

## We also learned to use the attribute method to get the values of the selected element.

## For my third lab assignment I worked with Aeone. I learned to use the select tags and how to hide and show the content in the drop down menu when a event occurs.
