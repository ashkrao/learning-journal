## I am really enjoying working on the Lab assignments. I still have to get acquainted to JSON format though.

## My pair programming with Don went well. We got our code to work last evening but got back together and worked on it to add the success and error message while fetching data for class 6 assignment.  

## Excited to explore nodejs later this week.
