### I am so relieved that the project presentation is over. Our project was pretty good compared to many other teams. We are a strong team and everyone contributed equally. I feel adding more features may have caused problems and we as a team made the right decision to stick to our initial plan to not modify the code to add additional themes.

### This has been a great learning experience and I now have a fair understanding of how projects can be executed well if we have proper planning. We had so many good ideas but so little time to execute them.
