## After my internet was set-up yesterday, I worked on Code wars and the lab assignment from Friday.I Learned a few different ways to solve the same problem while working on the code wars assignments. Ternary operator is such a handy tool to keep your code concise and clean.

## I will go back and watch the youtube videos to understand the form building concept later today. My portfolio is looking good now. Thanks to Alana for helping me understand how to categorize the CSS files using SMACSS.
