#### Started on the final project. Happy that we decided to work on the project that I pitched. Looking forward to building a good product.

#### Got teamed up with 3 others and I was not sure how the work can be distributed between us. But we made good progress on the first day, and planned out our next steps.

#### It will be a challenge to give everyone on the team a chance to work on everything. But we can add more features to our project in case anyone feels that they didn't get to work on something.
