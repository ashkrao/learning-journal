## Database has always been an interesting topic for me. Getting Postgres to work was a challenge and thanks to the instructor team for helping me with that. I wish there was a better way to test the changes made to the table though.

## I know I will be using Microsoft's T-sql at some point and I look forward to using the skills I learned through this assignment.
