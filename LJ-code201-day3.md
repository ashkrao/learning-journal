## I am so exhausted. No sleep No food. I am not even sure if I want to do this anymore. This is too much information to digest.

## It's 1:30 am, I can literally hear my neighbor snoring and I am yet to submit my reading assignment. :( :(

## on the bright side, I am getting to learn so many new things each day. DOM seems very interesting. Being able to dynamically access and update the content, structure, and style of a document would save a lot of time and energy.
