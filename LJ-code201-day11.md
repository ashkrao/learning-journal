## Today was not the best day for me. I was looking forward to finishing up the local storage and finalizing the CSS but I had to take off in the noon because I could not concentrate on my work.

## I really missed out on all the fun our team had while deciding on the directions for our game. On the other hand, I took a nap after coming home and was super charged in the evening.

## I was able to work on one of our stretch goals which was to add a different theme to our page.I came up with an Idea where the user has to match different countries with their respective flags. While I was discussing this idea with the team, some of them felt it would be hard to implement a relative match meaning matching two images which are not Identical. I took it up as a challenge and wanted to try out a few things.I did not want to mess up the code that was up and running so I decided to branch out and create a separate JavaScript file for my theme. I used most of the JavaScript from our initial setup file and had to make some changes to the constructor by adding an object and Voila it worked!! .I tested this by comparing two images that were not identical.Once I had the functionality running, I went on to pick free images of flags on the internet and photoshopped them to be of the same size for the grid. I remembered my husband mentioning about a tool called Gimp for photo editing. I learned to use Gimp today and found it super useful for scaling images to desired size.
