## It's been a hectic week. I am getting to learn some interesting topics DOM, Events, Forms etc..

## I am a little behind on the reading assignments but have been submitting the Lab assignments on time.

## My bus stop has been moved due to road work and I am having to walk extra 0.3 miles for the connecting bus..Ughhh!
