## First week has been pretty hectic. No proper food not enough sleep. I feel like I signed up for more than what I can handle. One hr 30 mins commute each way is killing me. I feel I could have been more productive if I did not have to travel so much.

## Re-learned website basics like adding images to web pages, using fonts and other styling to make pages look pretty.

## Pair-programming was fun. Could not complete this task. Looking at others' code made me realize how the same code can be written in different ways.
